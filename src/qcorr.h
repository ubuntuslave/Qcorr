 @ingroup qcorr_mainwindow

 @brief A Digital Image Correlation Program (Template Matching and Pixel Disparity Finder) implemented in QT4

 This class combines all other sub-classed QWidgets implemented throughout the program. The main correlation used in the "Template matching" and "Disparity Finder" modes rely strongly in the functionality implemented in this class through the procedure convertToGrayScaleFloat()

 @note Correlation is performed on gray-scale (1 channel image) that are computed in this procedure through the convertToGrayScaleFloat() function.

 @par  Compile-time dependencies
    - The QT4 Framework
    - g++

 @bug
    - Perhaps a few around the rubberBand functionality, and others not noticed yet.

 @todo
    - Use pyramids method for faster correlation
    - Better disparity map implementation
    - Spacebar opens full screen mode on image.

       *          The square root of the sum of the squares (RSS) is being used to
       *          calculate the aggregate accuracy of a measurement when the accuracies of the all the measuring devices are known.
       *          The average accuracy is not merely the arithmetic average of the accuracies (or uncertainties), nor is it the sum of them.
       *
       * @param bMultires Determines if multiresolution correlation should be applied, by making use of image pyramids.
       *                 With multiresoltion, the correlation can be determined faster than direct correlation.
       *                 Default is false.
       * @param nInitialXPosition Indicates the x-coordinate of the pixel on the target image where correlation should start. Default is 0
       * @param nInitialYPosition Indicates the y-coordinate of the pixel on the target image where correlation should start. Default is 0
       * @param nNumberOfRows Indicates the number of rows on the target image to be scanned. Default is 0, which means all of them.
